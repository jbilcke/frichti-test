## Instructions

### User stories

Please, read the following user stories:

1. As a user I need to search a product through the menu.
2. As a user I need to have a responsive/adaptive interface that is usable in web-mobile.
3. As a user I need to filter the products according to certain allergens.

### Exercise

There are some comments in this exercise with the annotation `@todo`. These comments will point to the code you need to write to complete the user stories. Feel free to create files and folders if needed, but some files have already been initialized for you.

The definition of done for a user story is:

- [x] Feature works ;
- [x] Coding style is correct (ESLint, Stylelint, etc.) ;
- [x] Tests have been written (Jest, Storybook, etc.).

‚ö†Ô∏è You need to **complete at least 2 user stories** in a **maximum of 3 hours** (you have at most one week to return the assignment if you want to complete all).

## Notes

### General

- You can use third-party libraries but you can be asked to justify your choices.
- Take time to construct a good architecture.
- Testing is very important for us, so your app should be tested.
- At Frichti we really focus on details. Verify your work before sending it to us.
- Some tools are not fully configured, feel free to fix or remove them.

### Design & UX

A nice UX & UI touch and feel is very important to us. Take great care about how you display and style widgets. Don't worry, we are not asking you to be a CSS and design wizard along with being a JavaScript developer, but those appetences will be appreciated.
